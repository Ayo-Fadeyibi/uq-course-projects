# ReadySetHire – AI-Powered Interview Platform

ReadySetHire is a client-side web application developed as part of the COMP2140/7240 Web/Mobile Programming course at the University of Queensland.

The application is designed to streamline the interview workflow by allowing recruiters to create interviews, manage questions, and review applicant responses. Applicants interact with the system through a guided interview flow and provide spoken answers that are transcribed using speech-to-text functionality.

This project focuses on building a modern React-based interface that communicates with a RESTful API for data persistence.
