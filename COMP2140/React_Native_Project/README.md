# FormBase – Dynamic Mobile Form Builder

FormBase is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo as part of the COMP2140/7240 Web/Mobile Programming course at the University of Queensland.

The application is designed as a lightweight data-collection tool that allows users to dynamically create custom forms, define flexible field types, and store structured records using a RESTful API. The project focuses on building a functional, interactive, and mobile-first user experience while demonstrating core React Native and Expo concepts.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project was developed to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Building mobile applications using React Native and Expo
- Implementing file-based routing with Expo Router
- Managing component state and user interactions
- Consuming RESTful APIs for data persistence
- Designing intuitive mobile user interfaces
- Working with device capabilities (camera, images, location)

---

## 🚀 Core Features

FormBase enables users to:

### Form Management
- Create and manage custom forms
- Edit form details
- Define flexible data structures through dynamic fields

### Field Types
Forms may include a variety of field types:

- Text Input
- Multiline Text
- Dropdown / Select Fields
- Image / Camera Capture
- Location Capture

Additional field attributes include:

- Required fields
- Numeric validation

---

## 📊 Record Management

Users can:

- Enter and save records associated with forms
- View records in a structured list
- Copy or delete records
- Apply search and filtering logic

Filtering capabilities include:

- Text-based matching
- Numeric comparisons

---

## 🗺️ Location Visualisation

Location-enabled records can be visualised through map integration, allowing users to explore geospatial data directly within the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

This project was built using:

- **React Native** – Mobile UI framework
- **Expo** – Development environment & tooling
- **Expo Router** – File-based routing system
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** – Application logic
- **Fetch API** – API communication
- **RESTful API** – Data storage and retrieval

Optional UI libraries / frameworks may include:

- NativeWind / React Native Paper / GlueStackUI (where permitted)

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Functional components & hooks
- State management
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- File-based routing
- API interaction & asynchronous data handling
- Device API usage (camera, images, location)

---

## 📌 Notes

- This is an academic assessment project for COMP2140/7240.
- Authentication and login systems are intentionally excluded.
- Data persistence is handled via the provided RESTful API.
- The application is designed as a prototype rather than a full SaaS product.
